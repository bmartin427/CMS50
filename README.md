# CMS50
Command-line python tool for data download from Contec CMS50 pulse oximeter devices

This tool will download the log data from the device to a local .csv file, and supports plotting data from the device or from previously-dumped .csvs.  It has been tested on a CMS50D+ device at firmware version 4.6, but will likely work with other related devices, possibly with slight code tweaks.
